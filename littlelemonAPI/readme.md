How to create and submit your project

You need to use pipenv to create the virtual environment and to manage the dependencies. Your APIs should be created using Django, DRF and Djoser. You need to use SQLite as the database for this project. You can develop your APIs using VS Code and test them using your browser or Insomnia. 

Name the project directory LittleLemon and the app LittleLemonAPI. Ensure that you follow this naming convention to make the reviewing process easier. 

You will be required to submit your APIs by uploading a zipped folder that contains your code. 

Important note: Include the sqlite database file db.sqlite3 in your project submission and share the superuserâ€™s username and password of all the other users you have created. Write these usernames and passwords in a notes.txt file and keep it inside the project directory and then zip the project.
